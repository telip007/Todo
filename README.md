### Summary
This scaffolded application provides a starting point for creating Swift applications running on [Kitura](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/kitura/).

### Requirements
* [Swift 3](https://swift.org/download/)

### Project contents
This application has been generated with the following capabilities and services:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Embedded metrics dashboard](#embedded-metrics-dashboard)
* [Docker files](#docker-files)
* [CouchDB](#couchdb)

#### Embedded metrics dashboard
This application uses the [SwiftMetrics package](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/SwiftMetrics) to gather application and system metrics.

These metrics can be viewed in an embedded dashboard on `/swiftmetrics-dash`. The dashboard displays various system and application metrics, including CPU, memory usage, HTTP response metrics and more.
#### Docker files
The application includes the following files for Docker support:
* `.dockerignore`
* `Dockerfile`
* `Dockerfile-tools`

The `.dockerignore` file contains the files/directories that should not be included in the built docker image. By default this file contains the `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile-tools`. It can be modified as required.

The `Dockerfile` defines the specification of the default docker image for running the application. This image can be used to run the application.

The `Dockerfile-tools` is a docker specification file similar to the `Dockerfile`, except it includes the tools required for compiling the application. This image can be used to compile the application.

Details on how to build the docker images, compile and run the application within the docker image can be found in the [Run section](#run) below.
#### CouchDB
This application uses the [Kitura-CouchDB package](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-CouchDB), which allows Kitura applications to interact with a CouchDB database.

CouchDB speaks JSON natively and supports binary for all your data storage needs.

Boilerplate code for creating a client object for the Kitura-CouchDB API is included inside `Sources/Application/Application.swift` as an `internal` variable available for use anywhere in the `Application` module.

The connection details for this client are loaded by the [configuration](#configuration) code and are passed to the Kitura-CouchDB client in the boilerplate code.

#### Models
This project only holds one model. The model is called `Todo` and is added as a struct in swift
```swift 
struct Todo {
    public static var type: String {
        return "todo"
    }
    let id: String
    let title: String
    let createdAt: UInt
    let updatedAt: UInt
    
    var json: JSON {
        return JSON([
            "type": Todo.type,
            "id": id,
            "title": title,
            "createdAt": createdAt,
            "updatedAt": updatedAt
            ])
    }
    
}
```

### Configuration
Your application configuration information is stored in the `config.json` in the project root directory. This file is in the `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being stored in git.

The connection information for any configured services, such as username, password and hostname, is stored in this file.

The application uses the [Configuration package](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Configuration) to read the connection and configuration information from this file.

### Run
To build and run the application:
1. `swift build`
1. `.build/debug/todoApp`

**NOTE**: On macOS you will need to add options to the `swift build` command: `swift build -Xlinker -lc++`

#### Docker
To build the two docker images, run the following commands from the root directory of the project:
* `docker build -t myapp-run .`
* `docker build -t myapp-build -f Dockerfile-tools .`
You may customize the names of these images by specifying a different value after the `-t` option.

To compile the application using the tools docker image, run:
* `docker run -v $PWD:/root/project -w /root/project myapp-build /root/utils/tools-utils.sh build release`

To run the application:
* `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD:/root/project -w /root/project myapp-run sh -c .build-ubuntu/release/todoApp`
